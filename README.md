# My City My Team

My first project was designed to showcase my knowledge of APIs as well as basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. Our requirements were to pick virtually any 2 APIs and make a website from it. The APIs would have to be instructor approved. My partner and I chose for this project to use the Youtube Data API as well as an API for basketball stats called BallDontLie. Going into the project we had done about 2 weeks learning HTML and CSS and the rest of the time mostly JavaScript concepts. The idea of doing an entire project was slightly intimidating at first, however when taking into consideration the fact that we could choose any concept for the project we wanted to as long as it met minimum requirements and also got to work with another person, it made it more reasonable. One of the primary challenges I faced on this project was how we could set the app up to search by the players' names when at first it appeared we could only search by id number. After some time mulling it over and getting advice from various sources, I discovered we could do 2 AJAX calls to the database. The first one would get the player's ID number and the second would plug that ID number into our next call to the database,
